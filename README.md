## How to run it?
### Requirements

- Installed latest <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Xcode</a>
- Installed latest <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>
- Organization with <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/">VGS</a>


#### Step 1

Go to your <a href="https://dashboard.verygoodsecurity.com/" target="_blank">VGS organization</a> and establish <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/getting-started/quick-integration#securing-inbound-connection" target="_blank">Inbound connection</a>. For this demo you can import a pre-built Routes configuration:

</p>

-  Inside the app repository find **configuration.yaml** file and download it.
-  On the <a href="https://dashboard.verygoodsecurity.com/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> screen go to the **Routes** section and selet **Inbound** Tab. 
-  At the right corner you will see **Manage** button. Press it and select **Import YAML file**, then choose **configuration.yaml** that you just download and **Save** the Rout.
-  Now the cards data you send by VGSCollectSDK will be secured.


#### Step 2

Clone Very Spacy Food application repository.

``git@github.com:verygoodsecurity/very-spacy-food.git``

#### Step 3

Install application pods.

Open Terminal and change working directory to `Very Spacy Food` application folder:

    $ cd very-spacy-food

Install pods:

    pod install

If you already try the app before, you can check for pod updates to get the latest SDK version. In Terminal run the command:

    pod update


#### Step 4

In `Very Spacy Food` folder find and open with Xcode `Very Spacy Food.xcworkspace` file (not - `Very Spacy Food.xcodeproj`).
In the app go to `CollectCreditCardDataViewController.swift` file, find the line:

    let vaultId = "vaultId"

and replace `vaultId` with your organization
 <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/terminology/nomenclature#vault" target="_blank">vault id</a>. 
 
### Step 5 

Run the application and try to order some Very Spacy Food.</br>

#### When on Add Credit Card Data sceen

You can use test credit card data to make the order, e.x.:

``` swift

/// Cardholder Name 
Joe Business

/// Visa Test Card Number   
4111111111111111

or

/// Custom Brand Card Number
911 11111111 1111

/// Exp. Date  
11/22

/// CVC code
123

```
Press the **Save** button and the data will be submitted to VGS.  
Go to the Logs tab on <a href="http://dashboard.verygoodsecurity.com" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>, find request and secure a payload.  
Instruction for this step you can find <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/getting-started/quick-integration#securing-inbound-connection" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Step 6

Check examples for how to integrate **VGSCollectSDK** into your app.

`CollectCreditCardDataViewController.swift`is build with VGSCollect Forms. You can check how to customise SDK UI elemetnts, observe field states(validation, card bin & last 4 numbers, card brand, etc), submit data to VGS. After you **submit** card data, VGS will return **alias** for each secured filed instead of raw data. Then you can use **alias** to store on your backend or make payments later.

`CheckoutViewController.swift` use not sensitive card data as card brand, card number bin and last 4 numbers to provide user info about his payment data. On **Pay** action app will send **alias** data to our test backend. For demo purpose backend actually do nothing but send "Success" in response if you reach it. 

Note that usually you shouldn't make a payment request to payment providers directly from your production app. For security reasons payment requests should be done from your backend. On payment request **alias** will go through **VGS forward proxy**. More information how to setup **Outbound** request from your backend is described <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/guides/outbound-connection" target="_blank"> here</a>
